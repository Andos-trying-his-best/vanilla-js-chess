# ♟️ Vanilla JS Chess

A fully functional chess game built from scratch using **pure JavaScript and DOM manipulation**.

No libraries. No frameworks. Just raw logic.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Full legal move validation for all pieces
- ✅ Pawn logic (1-step, 2-step, captures)
- ✅ Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King movement
- ✅ Check detection
- ✅ Checkmate detection
- ✅ Turn-based system
- ✅ Visual move highlighting
- ✅ Capture system
- ✅ Clean board reset after every move

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The project uses:

- `data-*` attributes to track piece type and color
- Manual move validation for each piece
- Event listeners attached dynamically to legal squares
- A check detection system that scans attacking squares
- A checkmate system that verifies escape possibilities

All logic is handled directly through DOM state — no external game engines.
